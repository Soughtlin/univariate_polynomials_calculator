This is a univariate polynomials calculator, which has addition, subtraction, multiple, derivation and other functions.
I will continue to add more function to this calculator and make it better.
And also, as a computational mathematics major student, this is the first repository that I create on GitHub, I am willing to study and explore on this platform in the future.

The program still has some defects, which have been noted in the code. I hope to fix them soon.
a brief description of 5 codes files:
main.cpp: main function is here.
polynomials.cpp(polynomials.h): core file that implement the function of this program.
menu.cpp(menu.h): a text menu interface for users.

Almost forget to mention that I am a chinese student, so annotations in codes are almost chinses. I will continue striving to learning English.
